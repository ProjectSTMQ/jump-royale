# jump-royale
An online multiplayer platforming game, based on [Jump King](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061090/Jump_King/).
This inspiration behind this project comes from a bet between friends on who could finish the original game first. We thought it would be a neat idea to have multiplayer functionality.
